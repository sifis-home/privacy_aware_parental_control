# Privacy-Aware Parental Control

The parental control analytic aims to recognize children acting in a surveilled environment, in order to restrict the actions they can perform, and to monitor their behavior for ensuring that they do not experience any dangers.  

The parental control analytic takes as input data the video frames produced by the surveillance cameras distributed into the controlled environment, such as the camera of the controlled device or the surveillance cameras deployed in the environment, and the metadata provided by the controlled devices. The combination of multiple cameras allows to create a global view of the monitored environment, thus improving detection accuracy. The metadata about devices allows to understand the policy associated to such devices, which could express conditions to be met in order to be allowed to use the device, e.g., the function f of the device can be performed only by an adult user.
